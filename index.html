                    <h2>My Strength is...</h2>
                    <p>
                        My biggest strength is that I work as a team player. Being a team player requires more than just
                        collaborative skills. A team player is someone who combines their personal abilities with
                        teamwork skills to complete tasks or move ahead with projects in a more effective way. In other
                        words, a team player is
                        goal-oriented. I always understand my role and my abilities when I am in a team. Additionally, I
                        will devote myself to the team and strive for the best for our team’s common goal, as well as
                        help one another in the team with all my abilities when it is needed. When I was in high school,
                        I was the one in class who initiated to form a study group. I became the bridge between my
                        classmates who we helped each other in the subject we were good at. Finally,
                        the university acceptance rates in our class were the highest, compared to other classes and the
                        ones in the past. There is
                        no you and me in a team as long as we are striving for the same goal.
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My strength is conspicuously applicable to both summative tasks and informative tasks. If my
                        classmates are aiming at getting better grades and improving themselves, then we could share our
                        knowledge and help each other with our biggest abilities whenever there are tests or
                        courseworks. More importantly, we support each other. I genuinely believe by
                        doing so we all could have a huge improvement by the end of the term as both tasks require
                        us to demonstrate our personal abilities and collobration skills in a certain way. Being a team
                        player could catalyse
                        the collaboration between teammates, thereby maximizing the effectiveness and efficiency of
                        achieving
                        our
                        common goal - getting better
                        grades.

                    <h2>My Motivation is...</h2>
                    <p>
                        My motive behind everything I do is the pursuit of entrepreneurship in tech industry.
                        Entrepreneurship is best defined as a tendency to start your business in your own ventures.
                        Having such achievement that could create positive values to the world is exactly what I desire.
                        It is difficult, if not impossible to become an entrepreneur in tech industry. Therefore, I have
                        an array of personal habits that are conducive of entrepreneurship. Paying attention to the
                        world’s news, exercising regularly, networking and mastering my programming skills as well as
                        knowledge are a list of my daily routines that are the cornerstones to success. Some might say
                        that these are the things everyone is able to do. It is noticeably true. However, what deviates
                        me from the norm is my attitude and ability.
                    </p>
                    My motivation is applicable to all the class types which are lectures, tutorials, and laboratories.
                    It is because these class types could hone my programming skills and broaden my knowledge in
                    computer science. These are exactly the basic criteria an entrepreneur should have. Moreover, I can
                    meet many talented
                    people and lecturers who we can share riveting
                    ideas regarding programming and technologies. The people I meet and the conversation I have with
                    them would be a steppingstone to my road of entrepreneurship as talented people and great ideas are
                    indispensable elements to entrepreneurship. With most of the criteria a successful entrepreneur
                    needs can be found in the class, it is only the time that matters.
